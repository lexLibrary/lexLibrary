# Changelog #

## master ##

## v4.1.14 ##
  * Allow specifying FetchLen and LOBFetchLen.
  * Add Rset.ColumnIndex helper function.

## v4.1.13 ##
  * Fix bindStirngSlice error of nullInds reuse without reset.

## v4.1.12 ##
  * Do not free ocistmt - panics (issue #222).

## v4.1.11 ##
  * Return ErrBadConn from ExecContext, QueryContext if the culprit is bad conn.
    Fixes #205.

## v4.1.10 ##
  * Fix missing OCI handle frees on error (issue #207).

## v4.1.9 ##
  * Fix context deadline issue 192.

## v4.1.7 ##
  * Fix missing Rset.Close in DrvQueryResult.Next.

## v4.1.6 ##
  * Fix memory consumption in defString.

## v4.1.5 ##
  * Allow Num, OraNum and OCINum as bind parameters.
  * Allow DRCP (Database Resident Connection Pooling).
  * Fix reconnection when disconnected from Oracle (return driver.ErrBadConn).
  * Fix LOB reading error happening only spuriously, under pressure - issue 159.

## v4.1.4 ##
  * Fix LOB reading (issue #159).
  * Remove ociErrorNL as it does locking, against its name and comment.
  * Remove all remaining ora.v3 traces.

## v4.1.3 ##
  * Open LOBs for reading only at the first read - this eliminates the error
    ORA-24804 when the Row contains more than one LOB.

## v4.1.2 ##
  * Fix LOB reading with ora.S by simplifying reading code and using AL32UTF8 explicitly.

## v4.0.1 ##
  * Add an ora.L type to specify ora.Lob as column type in Qry and Prep.

## v4.0.0 ##
  * Rewrite the tests to run parallel
  * Rewrite the tests to use subtests
  * Add RWMutex everywhere where needed to be -race-free
  * Change the configuration to use immutable structures (StmtCfg and RsetCfg).
    This means cfg.Set... methods returns a copy, does not change the original -
	you have to call drv/env/srv/ses/stmt/rset.SetCfg(cfg)!
  * Remove pooling from Con - that's already done in database/sql.
  * Allow setting column type to `S` for numeric columns
    (with `ora.SetCfg(ora.Cfg().SetNumberFloat(ora.S))`), too.
	This enables us you to `.Scan` into a `*string`.
  * Add Stmt.Parse for only parsing the query.
  * Fix open/close memory leak by adding more handle freeing - see #148.

## v3.8.0 ##
  * go1.8: support additional features, as requested by @kardianos in #127.
  * Change default column types for BLOB and CLOB: Bin and S, instead of D and D.
    With this change the driver will return a string/[]byte from [CB]LOB columns,
	instead of an io.ReadCloser.
  * Return driver.ErrBadConn for connection errors, to allow database/sql to reconnect.

## v3.7.4 ##
  * Add RTrimChar to StmtCfg, default true. This makes the strip of right padding of CHAR columns configurable.

## v3.7.3 ##
  * Fix a panic with Con.sysName.
  * Be more forgiving for empty/non-open/NULL result sets returned by Oracle.
  * Treat SQLT_INT columns returned by TimesTen just as SQLT_NUM.
  * Make *[]string, *[]{,u}int{16,32,64} and *[]{Ui,I}nt{16,32,64}, *[]Date bindable.
  * Use a bytesArena (sync.Pool-based []byte arena) for []byte allocations.

## v3.7.2 ##
  * Fix panic in Pool.Get - #118.
  * Make returned LOB colums obey the given GoColumnType, to be able to force the into string/[]byte - see #117.
  * Return nil for everywhere in def*.value, if possible (string is an exception, see #105, #106).

## v3.7.1 ##
  * Fix defDate NULL handling error resulting in reading garbage as Time.
  * Add Ses.SetAction to be able to set the session's Module and Action attributes.

## v3.7.0 ##
  * Add "C" field to Lob to allow setting bind parameters to CLOB (default is BLOB).
  * Add date.Date, an implementation for encode/decode Oracle 7 byte DATE format, to avoid the overhead of calling C.OCIDateTime... functions. And use it in Rsets.
  * Make ora.Date use date.Date.
  * Fix nested rsets (rset with rset as field).
  * Add a new Pool implementation, which has a simple 1-1 pairing between ses and srv - easier to use,
    and "automatically" correct for parallel execution.
  * get rid of NewSesCfg() and NewSrvCfg()

## v3.6 ##
  * Refactor def* (resultset columns) to be more common, and allow multiple row fetch.
  * Use multiple row fetch to speed SELECTs - closes issue #86.

## v3.5 ##
  * Modify default for CHAR(1) columns: use ora.S (string), NOT ora.B (bool).
  * Add connect " AS SYSDBA" functionality.

## v3.4 ##
  * Implement PL/SQL TABLE support to be able to call PL/SQL blocks/stored procedures with slices of simple types.
  * Add numberBigInt and numberBigFloat colum types.
    This allows tweaking the used column types for NUMBER columns with unknown scale/precision.
  * OCINum instead of OraNum - space saving and less C calls (implemented pure Go read/write of Oracle OCINumber, in num directory).

## v3.3 ##
  * Introduce new `Num` and `OraNum` data types and `N` Go Column Type to represent Oracle numbers fully, by exchanging them with Go as strings.
    Make `N` the default column type for numbers unrepresentable by int64 or float64 (more digits than 19 or 15).

## v3.2 ##
  * Rewrite for Go 1.6 cgo restrictions.

## v3.1 ##

  * Use the returned length info for several places when reading attributes - such as column names.
  * Use float64 for non-integer numeric column types.

## v3.0 ##

  * Big rewrite of handles to pool them properly.
